# Use Cases

Use Cases help capture what exists outside of the system (actors) and what should be performed by the system. These use cases
describe what components have been implemented throughout the entire project. Firstly, a Jamboard is included that contains 
all of the members ideas of what classes, functions, and methods are to be implemented. Next, use cases were required to
analyze what components were to be included and how each component corresponds to the next. Each use case is compiled with
all the necessary descriptions, actors, pre-conditions, post-conditions, and so on. Lastly, each use case includes a use
diagram which that supports the four use cases that were provided.

# User Story

The user story contains all of the major functionality of how the website is supposed to be executed when a user
decides to login and performed the required tasks. A table is created which contains all of grammatical parsing such as
nouns, objects, relationships and so on.
